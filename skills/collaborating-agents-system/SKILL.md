# Collaborating Agents System (Coordinator + Subagent Playbook)

Use this skill when operating the `collaborating-agents` extension so coordinators and subagents follow the same protocol.

## What this system provides

The extension gives you:

1. **Agent mesh + messaging** via `agent_message`
2. **File reservation locking** for write/edit coordination
3. **Subagent spawning** via `subagent`

## Core tools

### 1) `agent_message` (coordination + reservations)

Actions:

- `status` — self identity, focus, peer count, reservations
- `list` — active agents
- `sessions` — scoped subagent run/session records; completed/failed included by default, use `includeCompleted: false` for active only
- `session` — resolve one subagent run/session record
- `tail` — read a concise transcript tail for one subagent run/session (delta-friendly via `sinceOffset` / `nextOffset`; hard 3 KB payload cap; `mode: "status"` for a cheap status-only response)
- `send` — direct message to one peer (`to`, `message`, optional `replyTo`, optional `urgent`)
- `broadcast` — message all peers (`message`, optional `urgent`)
- `feed` — recent global message log (`limit`, default 20, max 400)
- `thread` — DM history with one peer (`to`, optional `limit`)
- `reserve` — reserve write/edit targets (`paths`, optional `reason`)
- `release` — release specific `paths`, or all if omitted

Delivery semantics (important):

- Normal messages (`urgent: false` or omitted) are delivered with Pi `followUp` (queued until the current turn completes).
- Urgent messages (`urgent: true`) are delivered with Pi `steer` (interrupt immediately).

Common calls:

```ts
agent_message({ action: "status" })
agent_message({ action: "list" })
agent_message({ action: "sessions" })
agent_message({ action: "sessions", includeCompleted: false })
agent_message({ action: "session", runId: "subagent-run-id" })
agent_message({ action: "tail", runId: "subagent-run-id" })
agent_message({ action: "tail", to: "latest" })
agent_message({ action: "send", to: "BlueFalcon", message: "Started task X" })
agent_message({ action: "send", to: "BlueFalcon", message: "Need decision now", urgent: true })
agent_message({ action: "broadcast", message: "Wave 2 complete" })
agent_message({ action: "thread", to: "BlueFalcon", limit: 20 })
agent_message({ action: "reserve", paths: ["src/server/"], reason: "auth refactor" })
agent_message({ action: "release", paths: ["src/server/"] })
```

Notes:

- In the `/agents` overlay, prefix message text with `!!` to send urgent.
- Use urgent only for blockers/decisions that cannot wait.

### Subagent session inspection

Coordinators should inspect spawned subagents through the run registry:

```ts
agent_message({ action: "sessions" })
agent_message({ action: "sessions", includeCompleted: false })
agent_message({ action: "session", runId: "subagent-run-id" })
agent_message({ action: "tail", runId: "subagent-run-id" })
agent_message({ action: "tail", to: "latest" })
```

Do not scan `~/.pi/agent/sessions` manually for normal subagent inspection. The `session` and `tail` actions scope lookups to the current coordinator and return helpful ambiguity or unavailable-session errors.

Supported selectors for `session` and `tail`:

- child run id / `recordId`: stable per-child id returned by `subagent`
- display name: readable launch/completion name
- canonical name: runtime subagent name stored in the registry/run record
- batch id: works only when one child matches; parallel batches are ambiguous and return candidates
- session id prefix: prefix of the Pi session id
- `latest`: newest subagent run for the current coordinator

`sessions` lists active, completed, and failed records for the current coordinator by default. Use `includeCompleted: false` to show only launching/running child runs. `tail` accepts selectors only, not raw file paths.

#### Delta tail (`sinceOffset` / `nextOffset`)

Every `tail` response returns `nextOffset` — the byte offset the reader is caught up to in the underlying session JSONL. Pass it back as `sinceOffset` on the next poll to receive only new bytes; the position lives entirely on the caller side, HTTP-Range / Kafka-consumer style, so there is no server cursor to reset.

```ts
const first = agent_message({ action: "tail", runId: "run-id" });
// ... later, only the new content:
const delta = agent_message({ action: "tail", runId: "run-id", sinceOffset: first.details.nextOffset });
```

If `sinceOffset` is stale (file truncated, replaced, or larger than the current size), the extension transparently resyncs to a tail-from-end read and returns a fresh `nextOffset` plus a `resynced: true` flag in `details`; one call restores the stream. A `sinceOffset` equal to the current file size returns an empty entry list.

#### Hard 3 KB payload cap

Every `tail` payload is clamped to ~3 KB (`TAIL_HARD_CAP_BYTES`) regardless of any caller-requested size. This applies to both tail-from-end and delta reads: a poll that would otherwise return more than 3 KB is truncated from the start (with `truncatedStart: true` in `details`), and the caller should poll more frequently or switch to `mode: "status"`.

#### Status-first mode (`mode: "status"`)

```ts
agent_message({ action: "tail", runId: "run-id", mode: "status" })
```

Returns no transcript — just `status` (`launching` / `running` / `completed` / `failed`) and, once the run is finished, the structured final report already captured in the run registry (`outputPreview`, `exitCode`, `completedAt`, `warnings`). Use this as the cheap heartbeat when the coordinator only cares whether the child is done and what it produced; switch to the default `mode: "full"` (with `sinceOffset`) only when you actually need transcript deltas.

Process mode launches a background `pi` child without a deterministic `--session` file. The extension records the session id from child output and attaches a session file after child self-registration or fallback discovery by session id. Until that happens, tailing may report: `Process-mode session file unavailable until child registration or fallback discovery provides one.` In `herdr-pane` mode, the extension creates an explicit session file under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/collaborating-agents-subagents/`.

## 2) `subagent` (spawn workers)

Modes:

- Single: `{ task }` or `{ type, task }`
- Parallel: `{ tasks: [{ task, cwd? }, ...] }` or `{ type, tasks: [...] }`

### Subagent Types (agent-type design)

Subagents are driven by **type configs** (TOML files). A type controls:

- system prompt
- optional model override
- optional reasoning level (`low | medium | high | xhigh`)

You can use built-in types (from `examples/subagents`) or override/add your own.

Common built-ins include:

- `worker` — general-purpose implementation (default)
- `scout` — fast discovery / codebase exploration
- `documenter` — docs and writeups
- `reviewer` — review / risk analysis
- plus many additional bundled specialists in `examples/subagents/*.toml`

#### Type discovery precedence

Later sources override earlier ones when `name` matches:

1. Bundled defaults: `examples/subagents/*.toml`
2. User overrides:
   - Legacy: `~/.pi/agent/subagents/*.toml`
   - Also supported: `~/.pi/subagents/*.toml`
   - Preferred: `~/.pi/agents/*.toml`
3. Project overrides (nearest ancestor from current cwd):
   - Legacy: `.pi/subagents/*.toml`
   - Preferred: `.pi/agents/*.toml`

So by default, bundled `examples/subagents` are used. Any matching config in the user/project override directories takes priority.

#### Default type resolution

When no `type` is passed:

1. use the highest-precedence non-bundled `worker.toml` override if present
2. else use the highest-precedence non-bundled `default.toml` override if present
3. else use bundled `worker` from `examples/subagents/*.toml`
4. else fallback to bundled `examples/subagents/worker.toml`
5. else use emergency inline worker prompt (rare)

#### TOML shape

```toml
name = "scout"
description = "Exploration specialist"
model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"   # optional
reasoning = "low"               # optional
prompt = """...required system prompt..."""
```

### Examples

```ts
// Default subagent type
subagent({ task: "Implement auth tags and report back via agent_message" })

// With specific subagent type
subagent({ 
  type: "scout",
  task: "Find all TypeScript files in src/" 
})

// Parallel subagents
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { task: "Implement backend pieces" },
    { task: "Implement frontend pieces" }
  ]
})

// Parallel with specific type (applies to all tasks)
subagent({
  type: "documenter",
  tasks: [
    { task: "Document backend API" },
    { task: "Document frontend components" }
  ]
})
```

### Slash command

Users can also spawn subagents via the `/subagent` command:

```
/subagent "Implement user authentication"
/subagent scout "Find all API endpoints"
/subagent documenter "Write README for auth module"
```

## Coordinator workflow (recommended)

1. **Discover peers**: `agent_message({ action: "list" })`
2. **Plan work split**
3. **Spawn workers** with `subagent`
4. **Track progress** using `sessions`, `session`, and `tail`; use `thread`/`feed` for explicit messages
5. **Coordinate reservations** so only one writer owns a target path
6. **Collect worker completion output** (auto-collected by orchestrator)
7. **Release reservations** after merge/finalization

### Automatic completion wake-up

By default, final subagent completions are visible but do not start a coordinator turn. Projects can set:

```json
{
  "subagentCompletionDisplay": "hidden",
  "triggerTurnOnSubagentCompletion": true
}
```

Hidden completion sends a minimal Pi custom-message wake token with `display: false` and child Run ID(s), not the child's final report. In the automatically triggered turn, inspect each result with `agent_message({ action: "session", runId })` and use `agent_message({ action: "tail", runId })` when transcript detail is needed. Full output remains in the durable run/session registry.

When automatic triggering is enabled, it replaces task instructions that tell the subagent to send an urgent completion DM solely to wake the coordinator. Do not use both for the same completion; the urgent DM and automatic trigger can race and produce competing turns.

For a fully quiet handoff, also set `subagentLaunchDisplay` to `"hidden"` (which suppresses launch and session-ready `pi.sendMessage` calls entirely) and `subagentProgressIntervalMs` to `0`. Defaults remain full visible launch/completion, normal session-ready behavior, progress every 30 seconds in pane mode, and no completion-triggered turn.

## Subagent workflow (required behavior)

Spawned workers use a subagent prompt based on their configured `type` (defaulting to a built-in prompt if no type is specified). At minimum they should:

1. At startup call:
   - `agent_message({ action: "status" })`
   - `agent_message({ action: "list" })`
2. Send direct updates to coordinator only when useful:
   - startup acknowledgement
   - blockers/questions needing input
3. Do **not** send a mandatory final DM summary; coordinator collects final output automatically.
4. Avoid broadcast progress unless explicitly requested.
5. Read before edit, keep changes scoped, run validation when possible.

Expected final report structure from workers:

- `## Summary`
- `## Files Changed`
- `## Validation`
- `## Notes`

## Reservation semantics (important)

- Reservation path ending with `/` means **directory prefix match**.
  - Example: `src/server/` blocks writes/edits under that directory.
- Reservation path without trailing `/` means **exact file match**.
- Conflicts block `write`/`edit` calls by other agents.
- Reads are still allowed.

Best practice:

- Reserve **before** first edit/write.
- Release as soon as ownership is no longer needed.
- Include a `reason` for auditability.

## Limits and defaults

- Parallel task count max: **8**
- Parallel runtime concurrency: `min(taskCount, 4)`
- One active `subagent` run at a time per orchestrator session
- Child recursion guard: blocked when depth >= max depth
  - Depth env: `PI_COLLAB_SUBAGENT_DEPTH`
  - Max env: `PI_COLLAB_SUBAGENT_MAX_DEPTH` (default 2)
- Spawned worker default tools:
  - `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `agent_message`

## Identity and storage

Base storage directory:

- Default: `~/.pi/agent/collaborating-agents`
- Override via env: `COLLABORATING_AGENTS_DIR`

Stored state:

- `registry/` — active agent registrations + reservations
- `inbox/` — per-agent message queue files
- `runs/` — durable subagent run/session records
- `messages.jsonl` — append-only global message log

Agent naming:

- `PI_AGENT_NAME` can force explicit agent name
- otherwise extension generates readable names and resolves collisions

## Failure handling

- `send`: fails if target is inactive, self-targeted, or message is empty
- `broadcast`: fails when no active recipients or message is empty
- `thread`: requires `to`
- `reserve`: requires non-empty `paths`
- `release`: if `paths` provided, must contain valid entries
- `session`/`tail`: return explicit errors for unknown selectors, ambiguous batch/display-name matches, missing session files, unavailable process-mode session files, unreadable files, and invalid non-JSONL files
- Subagent spawn may fail on recursion depth guard or process failure; inspect returned launch/result details

## Validation

Prefer `bun test` for validation. Useful focused checks:

```bash
bun test extensions/collaborating-agents/docs.test.ts
bun test extensions/collaborating-agents/index.test.ts --test-name-pattern "tool documentation metadata|agent_message subagent sessions|subagent launch identity"
bun test extensions/collaborating-agents/session-tail.test.ts
npm pack --dry-run
```

Keep `npm pack --dry-run` as the packaging check.

## Team protocol (concise)

- Prefer **direct** messages for task traffic
- Use **broadcast** only for milestone-level announcements
- Use `urgent: true` sparingly for time-critical blockers/decisions
- Reserve early, release promptly
- Keep worker scope narrow and report with structured output
- Coordinator is responsible for conflict resolution and final synthesis
